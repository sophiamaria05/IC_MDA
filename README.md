### Upload the files:
Open the Files at the left side menu and upload the [IC_codes.zip](https://github.com/sophiamaria05/IC_MDA/blob/update-code-to-first-official-version/IC_codes.zip "IC_codes.zip") and the XML files that you want to generate the Class Diagrams ("caso de uso xml.xml" in the following example)
